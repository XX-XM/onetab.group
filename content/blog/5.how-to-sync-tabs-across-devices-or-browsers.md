Once enabled, this feature will sync your tabs across all your devices. To do so, it will first ask you to `sign-in` with third-party account `Google` or `GitHub`. Once you've done that and signed in, your tabs will be available on any device where you're signed in, as long as the `Cloud Sync` feature is enabled.
