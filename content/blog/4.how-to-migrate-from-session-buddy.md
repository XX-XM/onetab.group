## Export your session from Session Buddy

Assuming you have both the Session Buddy and One Tab Group browser extensions installed in Chrome.

1. In Session Buddy, click on the menu icon in the top right-hand corner and select `Export`.

2. Choose your file format with `JSON`

3. Select which sessions you want to export - you can export all sessions, or just select saved ones.

4. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** button

Your sessions will now be exported as a JSON buffer which you can then import into One Tab Group.

2. A dialog window will appear that allows you to paste the JSON buffer you already copied from Session Buddy.

3. Click the **Confirm** button and wait for a while
