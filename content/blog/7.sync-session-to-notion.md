One Tab Group supports syncing the tabs and tab groups to the Notion database for further processing and management. In this case, we develop this sync feature based on the API provided by Notion.

:::alert{info}
Please note: This is a Pro feature
:::

## Support

- Push all the session into a specific page in Notion
- Push the specific session into the notion database
- Change the session info(such as change the session title) will be synced to Notion
- Delete the session from One Tab Group will be synced to Notion

## Cautions

- Please do not change、add、delete the database which named `Session Database` or `Session Database > Tab Database`
- There might be delay while syncing because the API calling speed is restricted (especially sync all session to Notion, depending on the number of tabs you saved).
