## Overview

As you accumulate more and more sessions with each workday, you may find yourself with a lot of useful sessions saved. You can think of the sessions you save as a `tab database`. So how do you efficiently retrieve them?

We built a `Raycast` extension for One Tab Group, which you might not have imagined could work together, but it does and it fits perfectly. It helps you search saved sessions and supports drilling down into tab groups. It supports searcing all the tabs you have saved without having to open the browser.

## What is Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.

## How it works

Once you have installed the `One Tab Group` extension from the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/store), you can start using it to search your saved browser tabs and tab groups.

Using `Raycast`, you can search for tabs and tab groups by typing in keywords. `Raycast` will show you a list of related sessions, tab groups, and tabs. For tab groups, you can drill down into it to look for the tab you want. When you find the tab you're looking for, simply click on it to open it in your browser.

The `One Tab Group` extension saves you time by making it easier to search and access your saved tabs and tab groups. Thanks to its integration with `Raycast`, it is easy to use and provides an enjoyable search experience.
