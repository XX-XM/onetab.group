**One Tab Group** also allows you to easily share your `session` with others. If you need to share a set of tabs with a colleague or friend, you can simply export the `session` as a URL and send it to them. They can then open the URL in their own browser and access the saved tabs. This is a convenient way to share information and collaborate with others.
